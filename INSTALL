Before starting the application, you must configure the WildFly.

server directory. To start the server, you must use the script "bin/standalone-openjst.sh"

Additionally you need to download and install 4.0.0.Alpha3 (http://www.jboss.org/modeshape/downloads).
From the downloaded archive "ModeShape subsystem for Wildfly 8.0" (modeshape-4.0.0.Alpha3-jboss-wf8-dist.zip) requires

existing files.
